## Proposed Project

My project will be a user interacted game of connect four. It will have a UI that simulates a board and will allow the user to either play against a friend or the computer. It will take click-events to determine what row it will be put on, and then check to see if the user has won.

## Outline Structure

The supervision structure will look like one supervisor that is overviewing all the playable games that will be their own processes. That way no two browser will mess the others up. At the moment there will be no frameworks needed for this project
